Given a pair of positive integers, for example, 6 and 110, can this equation 6 = 110 be true? The answer is "yes", 
if 6 is a decimal(十进制) number and 110 is a binary number.

Now for any pair of positive integers N1 and N2, your task is to find the radix of one number while that of the other
is given.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies a line which contains 4 positive integers:
N1 N2 tag radix
Here N1 and N2 each has no more than 10 digits. A digit is less than its radix and is chosen from the set {0-9, a-z}
where 0-9 represent the decimal numbers 0-9, and a-z represent the decimal numbers 10-35. The last number "radix" 
is the radix of N1 if "tag" is 1, or of N2 if "tag" is 2.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the radix of the other number so that the equation N1 = N2 is true. 
If the equation is impossible, print "Impossible". If the solution is not unique, output the smallest possible radix.
Sample Input 1:

6 110 1 10

Sample Output 1:

2

Sample Input 2:

1 ab 1 2

Sample Output 2:

Impossible


Algorithms and Data Structure:Data structure is not important in this question,we just to define tow
class to stand for two different radix number.We can according to tag which question giving to transfer this number
into decimal number,then we calculate the minimal radix according another number.For example,"ab" the minimal radix
is 11 ,so we can start from 11 to increase the radix until the two number is equal or print "Impossible" 


I have some question to ask the pronouncer:the question is say "If the solution is not unique, output the smallest possible radix".
I find a c plus plus program can pass all test but when I use a test data "1 1 1 10",its output is 10.But I think the right answer is 2
because the binary number "1" is also can be requested. So I feel this question is
